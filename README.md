# 1D-Heat-Diffusion-Simulation-Using-Finite-Difference-Method
 This project simulates 1D heat diffusion in a rod using the finite difference method. It includes a GUI for user-defined parameters (e.g., rod length, time steps) and dynamically visualizes temperature distribution over time, demonstrating heat transfer concepts.
