# README: 1D Heat Diffusion Simulation

---

## **Project Overview**
This project simulates 1D heat diffusion along a rod using the finite difference method. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for inputting simulation parameters and dynamically visualizes the temperature distribution as the simulation runs. The project demonstrates concepts in heat transfer, numerical methods, and computational physics.

## **Simulation Parameters**
- **Length of Rod (L)**: The physical length of the rod (e.g., 10 meters).
- **Total Simulation Time (T_max)**: The time over which the simulation runs (e.g., 100 seconds).
- **Number of Spatial Points (Nx)**: The number of segments the rod is divided into.
- **Number of Time Steps (Nt)**: The number of time steps for the simulation.
- **Thermal Diffusivity (\u03b1)**: A constant describing heat transfer in the material.
